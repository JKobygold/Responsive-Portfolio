                <p> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that if you have a string attached to a space station, and it is cut, then by god, you are  endowed by 
                    your creator with certain unalienable rights, to do whatever you want. These include <br>
                         <strong>life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness</strong>. That to secure these rights, staceships are instituted with long strings and men, who- deriving their just powers
                    from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of spaceship becomes destructive of these ends- and looses your rope/strong it is the right of the Astronaut to flail flail in space- laying one these foundational such principles t their safety and happiness shall reside.
